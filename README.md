# Clustering - (Data Science - 3)

Clustering : Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. In simple words, the aim is to segregate groups with similar traits and assign them into clusters.

Here , I plotted some graphs based on my data science projects -> Every planets data from Every Solar System , Every planets gravity data from Every Solar System and Data Of Gravity and they Stars.
